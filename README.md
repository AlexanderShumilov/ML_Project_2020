## "On scalable and efficient computation oflarge scale optimal transport"

Optimal transport is one of the popular methodsused in ML, e.g.  for domain adaptation or sam-ple generation. But due to the heavy computingload, this method is difficult to use everywhere.To solve this problem, the SPOT algorithm wasdescribed, the operation of which was tested inthis project. SPOT (Scalable Push-forward of Op-timal Transport) is an implicit generative learning-based framework by which the optimal transportproblem is casted into a minimax problem andthen is efficiently solved by primal dual stochasticgradient-type algorithms. In this work SPOT wastested on Gaussian distribution toy dataset andused for domain adaptation and image generation.
